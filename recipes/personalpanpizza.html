            <h4>A perfectly cooked homemade personal pan pizza</h4>
            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/3 cup warm water</li>
                <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1/4 cup pizza sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>Your favorite toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, etc.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl, combine warm water and yeast. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until frothy.</li>
                <li>Add flour, salt, and olive oil to the yeast mixture. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
                <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
                <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a cloth, and let it rise for about 1 hour until doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C).</li>
                <li>Punch down the dough and roll it out into a circle that fits your personal pan or baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Transfer the dough to the pan. Spread pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce and add your favorite toppings.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
                <li>Remove from oven, let cool for a few minutes, slice, and enjoy your homemade personal pan pizza!</li>
            </ol>
