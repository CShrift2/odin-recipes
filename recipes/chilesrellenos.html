            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil (for frying)</li>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Roast the poblano peppers over an open flame or under a broiler until the skin is charred. Place them in a plastic bag to sweat for about 10 minutes, then peel off the skin. Make a slit down the side of each pepper and remove the seeds.</li>
            <li>Stuff each pepper with shredded Monterey Jack cheese.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. In another bowl, beat the egg yolks until thickened. Gently fold the yolks into the whites.</li>
            <li>Dredge each stuffed pepper in flour, then dip it into the egg mixture, ensuring it is well coated.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry each pepper until golden brown on all sides. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>In a separate pan, saut√© chopped onion and minced garlic until translucent. Add tomato sauce, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the tomato sauce over the fried chiles rellenos and serve hot. Enjoy your delicious chiles rellenos!</li>
